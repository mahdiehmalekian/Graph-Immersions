# Graph-Immersion


In this repository, I put my codes for working with (weak) immersion relation in graphs.


## K_3,3 immersion
This folder contains my code for finding obstructions to immersion of K_3,3.

## Rooted W_4 immersion

In this folder, you will find my code for finding obstructions to immersion of rooted W_4
 (the 4-wheel graph with its center as the root) in a rooted graph.
