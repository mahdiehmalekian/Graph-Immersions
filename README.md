# Graph-Immersion


In this repository, I put my codes for working with (weak) immersion relation in graphs. The codes are written in python.


## K_3,3 immersion
In this folder, I've put my codes for finding obstructions to immersion of K_3,3. The main code is 'k33_obstructions.py' and its output is
saved in 'K_3,3 obstructions.txt'. I have also included a drawing of non-generic obstructions to immersion of K_3,3 in 'drawing K_3,3 obstructions.ipynb'.

The result of this code is used in the following paper: DeVos, Malekian, The structure of graphs with no K_3,3 immersion, https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12873.


## Rooted W_4 immersion
In this folder, you will find the python code for finding obstructions to immersion of rooted W_4 (the 4-wheel graph with its center as the root) in a rooted graph.
The main code is 'rooted_w4_obstructions.py' with its output saved in 'rooted W_4 obstructions.txt'. You can also see a drawing of the non-generic
obstructions in 'drawing rooted W_4 obstructions.ipynb'. The rest of the files are the modules used in the code. 

The result of this code is used in the paper DeVos, Malekian, The structure of graphs with no W_4 immersion, https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12863.
