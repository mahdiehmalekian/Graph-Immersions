# Rooted W_4 immersion

In this folder, you will find the python code for finding obstructions to immersion of rooted W_4 (the 4-wheel graph
 with its center as the root) in a rooted graph.
The code whose output is the obstructions to rooted W_4 immersion is 'rooted_w4_obstructions.py' with its output saved
 in 'rooted W_4 obstructions.txt'. You can also see a drawing of the non-generic
obstructions in 'drawing rooted W_4 obstructions.ipynb'. The rest of the files are the modules used in the code. 

The result of this code is used in the paper DeVos, Malekian, The structure of graphs with no W_4 immersion,
 https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12863.
