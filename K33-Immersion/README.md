# K_3,3 immersion

In this folder, I've put my codes for finding obstructions to immersion of K_3,3. The codes are written in python.
The file which gives the obstructions to K_3,3 immersion is 'k33_obstructions.py' and its output is
saved in 'K_3,3 obstructions.txt'. I have also included a drawing of non-generic obstructions to 
immersion of K_3,3 in 'drawing K_3,3 obstructions.ipynb'.

The result of this code is used in the following paper: DeVos, Malekian, The structure of graphs with no K_3,3 immersion, https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12873.
